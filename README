A simple implementation of speck 128/128. It also includes CBC encryption and
decryption. 

The file test.c just runs a couple test vectors. Useful to make sure it's
properly. It will test the functions to some expected output.

Note: It does use the the compiler extension __int128. It's supported by both
gcc and clang. Not sure about other compilers.
